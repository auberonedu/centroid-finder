# üì∏ Centroid Finder ‚Äî End-to-End Salamander Tracking System

Centroid Finder is a full-stack application built to process video and image files by detecting color-based centroids ‚Äî ideal for lab experiments like salamander pheromone preference tracking. It combines a powerful Java backend for image/video analysis, a Next.js frontend for interaction and control, and an Express API to manage processing jobs.

## üß© Project Structure

| Layer        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React + Next.js interface for selecting videos, adjusting color threshold, previewing results, and downloading CSVs |
| **Backend**  | Express.js API that manages processing jobs and interacts with the Java engine |
| **Processor**| Java-based binary image processor that detects pixel clusters and outputs centroid data |
| **Docker**   | Containerizes the system for reproducible deployments |
| **Testing**  | End-to-end testing powered by Cypress and JUnit |

# üõ†Ô∏è Installing and Running Docker

## Prerequisites

### Step 1: Install Docker

Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications in containers. Think of it like a virtual box that contains everything needed to run this project.

#### For Windows:
1. Go to [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
2. Download and run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Restart your computer when prompted
5. Open Docker Desktop and wait for it to start (you'll see a whale icon in your system tray)

#### For Mac:
1. Go to [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
2. Download the appropriate version for your Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon)
3. Drag Docker to your Applications folder
4. Launch Docker Desktop and follow any setup prompts
5. Wait for Docker to start (you'll see a whale icon in your menu bar)

#### For Linux:
1. Follow the instructions for your specific distribution at [Docker Engine Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. After installation, you may need to add your user to the docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
3. Log out and back in for changes to take effect

### Step 2: Verify Docker Installation

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like "Docker version 24.x.x". If you get an error, Docker isn't installed correctly.

## Running the Project

### Step 3: Create Folders for Your Data

Before running the project, you need to create folders on your computer where the application will store videos and results.

1. **Create a folder for videos**: This is where you'll put video files that the application will process
2. **Create a folder for results**: This is where the application will save its output

For example:
- **Windows**: Create `C:\salamander-videos` and `C:\salamander-results`
- **Mac/Linux**: Create `~/salamander-videos` and `~/salamander-results`

### Step 4: Download and Run the Application

Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands one at a time:

#### Download the application:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jameson789/salamander:latest
```
This downloads the Salamander application from the internet. It might take a few minutes.

#### Run the application:
Replace the folder paths below with the actual paths to the folders you created in Step 3.

**For Windows (using PowerShell or Command Prompt):**
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -v "C:\salamander-videos":/videos -v "C:\salamander-results":/results ghcr.io/jameson789/salamander:latest
```

**For Mac/Linux:**
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -v ~/salamander-videos:/videos -v ~/salamander-results:/results ghcr.io/jameson789/salamander:latest
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Once the application is running (you'll see log messages in your terminal), open your web browser and go to:
- `http://localhost:3001` - Web App(where the application actually runs)
- `http://localhost:3000` - Backend API(runs behind the scenes)

## Understanding the Command

Let's break down what that long `docker run` command does:

- `docker run` - Tells Docker to start a new container
- `-p 3000:3000` - Maps port 3000 on your computer to port 3000 in the container (for the web interface)
- `-p 3001:3001` - Maps port 3001 on your computer to port 3001 in the container (for additional services)
- `-v localVideoPath:/videos` - Connects your local videos folder to the container's `/videos` folder
- `-v localResultsPath:/results` - Connects your local results folder to the container's `/results` folder
- `ghcr.io/jameson789/salamander:latest` - The name and version of the application to run

## Customizing Ports (Optional)

If ports 3000 and 3001 are already being used by other applications on your computer, you can change them. For example:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:3000 -p 8081:3001 -v ~/salamander-videos:/videos -v ~/salamander-results:/results ghcr.io/jameson789/salamander:latest
```

Then access the application at `http://localhost:8081` instead.

**Important**: Always keep the numbers after the `:` as `3000` and `3001` - only change the numbers before the `:`.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application:
1. Go back to your terminal where it's running
2. Press `Ctrl+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+C` (Mac) 

Or: Terminate the process in the docker application itself using the red Trash can button. 

## Troubleshooting

### "Docker command not found"
- Docker isn't installed or isn't in your system PATH
- Try restarting your terminal/computer after installation

### "Port already in use"
- Another application is using ports 3000 or 3001
- Use different ports (see "Customizing Ports" section above)

### "Cannot connect the Docker daemon"
- Docker Desktop isn't running
- Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully load

### "No such file or directory" (folder path errors)
- Check that the folders you specified actually exist
- Make sure you're using the correct path format for your operating system
- On Windows, use forward slashes `/` or escape backslashes `\\`
