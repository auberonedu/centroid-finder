## Urgent 
**No tasks at this time.**

## Medium
- Validate that main correctly filters non-video files
- Update documentation and comments:
    - Main 
        - Edit top level documentation (done, would like second eyes on it)
    - Video Processor
        - Add top level documentation
        - Add function documentation
    - Largest Centroid
        - Add top level documentation
- Add more tests to VideoProcessorTest
    - Brainstorm more tests and **list them here**.

## Low / Aspirational
- User can set frequency of image collection
- Add fourth column to CSV that says "left", "mid", "right"
    - User set locations of boundaries
    - User set names of sections
- Create video representation of centroid moving 
    - (Make new video with same dimesions as original, just display largest centroid [maybe with a green circle])
