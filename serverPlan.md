# Server Application Plan

## Project Overview

The goal is to build an application that communicates with the back-end server to handles API requests for the Salamander Tracker system. The application should support:

- **GET requests**: Return data such as a list of available videos for processing.
- **POST requests**: Accept video processing requests and run our previously developed JAR file.
- **Job tracking**: Monitor the status of each processing job (we're still deciding whether to use a database or the filesystem for this).
- **Result delivery**: Return a downloadable CSV file containing the processed data and possibly an image of the first frame of the video for user preview.

## Implementation Strategy

We'll implement the separate routes outlined in the salamander-api for each required functionality:

- Handling GET and POST requests.
- Triggering the video processing JAR.
- Tracking job progress and status.
- Serving output files and other relevant responses.

## Testing and Validation

Once the routes are implemented, we will conduct comprehensive testing to ensure all endpoints and application logic work as we intended.
