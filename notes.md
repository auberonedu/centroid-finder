Image Summary App
    -   main

            if(args.length < 3)
        This is going to be reading in the args - meaning the command in the console from the user, if it is less then the length 3 it will output something

            - the main has 3 main arguments its looking for
                - The input image location
                - the hex target color it is looking for
                - an integer for binarization - idk what that means 

        It is going to create 2 string variables 
        -   The first is going to be to store the image path
            inputImagePath
        - The second is going to be to store the target color
            hexTargetColor
