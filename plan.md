We want to implement the centroid algorithm first to locate biggest centroid, which should be the first in the index from the algorithm we wrote because it was sorted largest to smallest.

Similar to our VideoExperiment.java, while the while loop is running we want to run the getX() and getY() every frame and store that information in the CSV. 

Potentially turn every frame into .png and then run the algorithm to grab x and y coordinates from those pngs for every frame.
